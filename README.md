# QKeyboardWidget
Qt Keyboard Widget for implementing keyboards on embedded devices

## Goals
The aim of this branch is to try to achieve the same functionality currently present in the main branch but implemented on top of a QStackedWidget and QGridLayouts for performance and features reasons. Once (if) achieved, the old functionality will be deprecated and this one will be default.
